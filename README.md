# MyReads Project

This is a completed project based for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. A [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) provided by Udacity was used as a template for this application. 

## App Description 

The React-based application allows a user to track and categorize books from a library. The user can add into three different categories: 
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

The user can search for books on a search page and add them to a list based on the three categories. 

## How to run

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.
